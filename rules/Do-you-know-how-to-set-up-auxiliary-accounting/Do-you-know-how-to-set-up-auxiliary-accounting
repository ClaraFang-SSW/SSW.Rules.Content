Auxiliary Accounting is a powerful tool that attaches "tags" or "dimensions" to a general ledger account, allowing for detailed tracking beyond the main account balance. For the "Accounts Receivable" account, its primary use is to link the "Customer" auxiliary dimension.

1120 Accounts Receivable
1120.001 Accounts Receivable - Customer A
1120.002 Accounts Receivable - Customer B
1120.003 Accounts Receivable - Customer C
... (This list becomes unmanageable with hundreds of customers.)
This causes your chart of accounts to become bloated, inefficient, and difficult to maintain.

The Auxiliary Accounting Solution:
Setup: Use one main account (1120 Accounts Receivable) and enable the "Customer" dimension for it.
Entry: When posting an invoice to this account, the system prompts you to select a specific customer.
Result: Each transaction is automatically tagged (e.g., 1120 Receivable | Customer A).
